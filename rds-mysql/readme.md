# üöÄ Deploying AWS MYSQL RDS: Two Approaches  

There are **two ways** to deploy an **Amazon RDS instance**:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Using Terraform AWS RDS Module** ‚Äì More automated, reusable, and secure.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Using `aws_db_instance` Resource** ‚Äì Simpler but requires manual configuration.  

Both methods achieve the same result but differ in flexibility and security.

### Key notes:
comment of the file before deploying.
RDS must be in two subnets.
